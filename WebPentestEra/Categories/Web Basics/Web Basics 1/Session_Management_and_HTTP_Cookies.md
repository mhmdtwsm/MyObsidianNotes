# 🍪 Session Management & HTTP Cookies


### 🔑 Why Don't You Have to Log In Every Time?

- Websites use **session management** to keep you logged in.
    
- A **session** starts when you log in and ends when you log out (or after a timeout).
    
- The server creates a **session ID** that proves your identity for the current session.
    

### 🧾 How It Works

1. You log in with your credentials.
    
2. The **server assigns a session ID** (e.g., `@yJT$U4lx6F2QZx`) and sends it to your browser.
    
3. Your browser stores the session ID as a **cookie**.
    
4. With every request to the same site, the browser **sends the session cookie**.
    
5. The server reads the cookie to know **you're still logged in**.
    

### 🔒 Logging Out

- When you **log out**, the server invalidates the session ID.
    
- This means the session is over, and the cookie can’t be reused.
    

### 📦 What's an HTTP Cookie?

- A small piece of data sent from server to browser.
    
- Used to store **session IDs** and other info.
    
- Automatically included in **every future request** to the same domain.
