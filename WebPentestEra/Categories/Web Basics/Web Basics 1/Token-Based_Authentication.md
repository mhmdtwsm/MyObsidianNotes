# 🔐 Token-Based Authentication



### 🆚 Compared to Session-Based Auth

- **Session-based:** Server stores session info + uses a session ID to identify users.
    
- **Token-based:** Server gives the user a **token** that **contains identity info**.
    
- No need to store sessions on the server—just **decode the token**.

### ⚠️ Risks with Tokens

- If identity is stored _inside_ the token, users might **modify it** to impersonate others.
    
- **Mitigation methods:**
    
    - **Encoding/Encrypting** the token (makes tampering harder).
        
    - **Signing** the token (most reliable).

### ✅ Why Sign Tokens?

- A **signature** is generated using a **secret key** only the server knows.
    
- If the signature is valid → the token is likely **not altered**.
    
- Prevents forgery even if someone decodes the token.

### 🔁 Authentication Flow

<img src="../../../photos/Categories/Web%20Basics/Web%20Basics%201/AUTH_TOKEN.png" width=600>
1. User logs in with credentials.
    
2. Server validates and issues a **signed token**.
    
3. User includes the token in every future request.
    
4. Server verifies token signature, reads identity from the token, and responds.
