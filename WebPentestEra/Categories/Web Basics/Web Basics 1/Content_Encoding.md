# Why?

**Content Encoding** is important to transfer binary and raw data without loss. Many of the raw data made of **Sequence of bytes** which can be **non-printable characters, control characters, or special symbols**.

Sending special characters and raw data like the previous may trigger a lot of problems in the HTTP requests.

Raw data is written as binary (0s and 1s) or as byte values. A PNG file for Example:

```raw
`\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n\x00\x00\x00\rIHDR\x00\x00\x02\x00...`
```

- It includes **non-printable characters** like `\x89`, `\x1a`, `\r`, `\n`
    
- Some of these (like `\r\n`, carriage return + line feed) are **used by internet protocols** to indicate things like "end of header" or "new line"
    
- If sent as-is in an HTTP message or email, the receiving system might interpret them **incorrectly as protocol instructions**, breaking the content.

On that, Encoding is a must because it transforms binary or unsafe characters into a limited, safe alphabet like:

```base64

```

Making the data **safe for transport** over HTTP, email, or other protocols.


# Types

### 📦 `Base64` Encoding

- Uses: `A–Z`, `a–z`, `0–9`, `+`, `/`, and `=` (for padding)
    
- Purpose: Safely transmits binary data using safe ASCII characters
    
- ✅ Efficient and commonly used
    

### 🌐 `Base64`URL Encoding

- Variant of `Base64` for URLs
    
- Uses different non-alphanumeric characters
    
- Omits padding (`=`)
    

### 🧮 Hex Encoding (Base-16)

- Characters: `0–9`, `A–F`
    
- Example: `"Content Encoding"` → `436f6e74656e7420456e636f64696e67`
    
- 🔴 Less space-efficient than `Base64`
    
- ✅ More human-readable
    

### 🌍 URL Encoding (Percent-Encoding)

- Converts characters to `%` followed by hex value
    
- Example: `localhost` → `%6c%6f%63%61%6c%68%6f%73%74`
