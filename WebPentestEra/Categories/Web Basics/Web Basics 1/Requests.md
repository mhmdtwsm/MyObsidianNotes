***Web applications are systems that function through requests and responses, operating over specific protocols.***

# HTTP Request

**`HTTP` is a set of rules that specifies how to structure and interpret internet messages, and how web clients and web servers should exchange information.**

Let's for example take this request to see how the things works:
```http 
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29
Authorization: Bearer abc123
Cookie: sessionid=xyz987
Connection: keep-alive

username=admin&password=12345
```

## **Request Line** - `POST /login HTTP/1.1`

- **HTTP Method**: Defines the action the client wants the server to perform (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- **Resource Path**: The URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or path that specifies the resource the client is requesting on the server (e.g., `/login`, `/profile`).
- **HTTP Version**: Specifies the version of the HTTP protocol used (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`).

### HTTP Method
There are two crucial methods to focus on, `GET` and `PUT`

#### `GET` Method

The `GET` method is used to retrieve data from the server without modifying it. It is commonly used for requests like viewing web pages, fetching resources, or performing searches.

- **Idempotent**: Multiple identical `GET` requests produce the same result without side effects on the server.

- **Request Parameters**: Data is sent as query parameters in the URL (e.g., `?key=value`).

- **No Body**: A `GET` request typically does not include a body.

- **Cached**: Responses to `GET` requests can be cached by browsers or servers for performance.

- **Visible in URL**: Query parameters are appended to the URL, making them visible in the browser and logged in server logs.

- **Length Limit**: URLs have length limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be sent with a `GET` request.
