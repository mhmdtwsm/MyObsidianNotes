Let's for example take this request to see how the things works:
```http 
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29
Authorization: Bearer abc123
Cookie: sessionid=xyz987
Connection: keep-alive

username=admin&password=12345
```

# **Request Line** - `POST /login HTTP/1.1`
