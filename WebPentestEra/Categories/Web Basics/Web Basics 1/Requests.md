***Web applications are systems that function through requests and responses, operating over specific protocols.***

# HTTP Request
#HTTP

**`HTTP` is a set of rules that specifies how to structure and interpret internet messages, and how web clients and web servers should exchange information.**

Let's for example take this request to see how the things works:
```http 
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29
Authorization: Bearer abc123
Cookie: sessionid=xyz987
Connection: keep-alive

username=admin&password=12345
```

## 1. **Request Line** - `POST /login HTTP/1.1`

- **HTTP Method**: Defines the action the client wants the server to perform (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- **Resource Path**: The URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or path that specifies the resource the client is requesting on the server (e.g., `/login`, `/profile`).
- **HTTP Version**: Specifies the version of the HTTP protocol used (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2`).

### HTTP Method
There are two crucial methods to focus on, `GET` and `PUT`

#### `GET` Method
#GET

The `GET` method is used to retrieve data from the server without modifying it. It is commonly used for requests like viewing web pages, fetching resources, or performing searches.

- **Idempotent**: Multiple identical `GET` requests produce the same result without side effects on the server.

- **Request Parameters**: Data is sent as query parameters in the URL (e.g., `?key=value`).

- **No Body**: A `GET` request typically does not include a body.

- **Cached**: Responses to `GET` requests can be cached by browsers or servers for performance.

- **Visible in URL**: Query parameters are appended to the URL, making them visible in the browser and logged in server logs.

- **Length Limit**: URLs have length limits, which restrict the amount of data that can be sent with a `GET` request.

```http
GET /search?query=web+security&page=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
```

### `POST` Method
#POST

The `POST` method is used to send data to the server, typically for creating or modifying resources. It is commonly used for form submissions, file uploads, or API requests.

- **Non-Idempotent**: Multiple identical `POST` requests may create duplicate resources or produce different results.

- **Request Parameters**: Data is sent in the body of the request, not in the URL.

- **No Length Restriction**: Unlike `GET`, the size of the data sent via `POST` is not limited by URL length.

- **Not Cached**: `POST` requests are generally not cached by default.

- **More Secure**: Data sent in the body is not visible in the URL, though it can still be intercepted if not encrypted (e.g., with HTTPS).

```http
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 29

username=admin&password=12345
```

## 2. **Headers**

**HTTP request headers**. These are used to pass additional information about the request to the server. This allows the server to customize results sent to the client.

- **`Host`**: Specifies the domain name of the server (needed for virtual hosting).

- **`User-Agent`**: Identifies the client software making the request (e.g., browser type, version).

- **`Content-Type`**: Defines the type of data being sent in the body (e.g., `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).

- **`Content-Length`**: The length of the data in the request body (if applicable).

- **`Authorization`**: Used for authentication, usually containing tokens or credentials.

- **`Accept`**: Specifies the media types that the client is willing to receive (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).

- **`Cookie`**: Contains cookies previously set by the server for the client.

- **`Connection` Header**: Controls whether the client-server connection remains open (`keep-alive`) for reuse or closes (`close`) after the request, improving performance in persistent connections.

- **`Referer` Header**:  indicates the URL of the previous web page (the referrer) from which the current request was made. It helps servers understand the context of the request, such as tracking user navigation or identifying the source of incoming traffic.

- **`Origin Header`**: Specifies the source (protocol, domain, and port) of the request, used primarily in cross-origin requests `CORS` to determine whether the request is allowed by the server.
	- Unlike `Referer`, it only includes the origin without the full URL path, enhancing privacy and security.
	
	- ***`CORS`*** is a security mechanism implemented in web browsers that allows or restricts web pages from making requests to a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than their own. It enables secure cross-origin communication between clients and servers. -Look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHiSt0oLJ0), [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtFSVU-YTI), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5FBwq-kudw) at last for `CORS` attacks -

## 3. **Body**

The body of the `HTTP` request carries the data to be sent to the server. This is particularly important for methods like `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`, where the client is submitting data (e.g., form data, `JSON`, files).

- **Form Data**: Data submitted from `HTML` forms, typically encoded as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.

- **`JSON`**: Used in API requests, often sent with `Content-Type: application/json`.

- **`XML`**: Another common format, especially in older APIs.

- **Binary Data**: Can include file uploads or other media.
