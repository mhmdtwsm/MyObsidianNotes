When you want to **join a team project** (like an open source codebase), you don’t just show up and start changing stuff. You need to say:

> "Hey, I agree to the rules, and I’m allowed to help!"

This is where **DCO** and **CLA** come in — they are like a **sign-in policy** for contributing code.

## DCO

>***DCO = Developer Certificate of Origin***

It’s like you saying:

> "I wrote this code myself, or I have permission to use it. And I’m okay with giving it to the project."

### Why it matters:

- Helps the project avoid legal trouble
    
- Proves that you’re not stealing code
    
- Super easy: no forms, just a line in your commit of code

```json
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```


# CLA

> **CLA = Contributor License Agreement**

It’s more official. You’re signing a legal document (usually online) that says:

> "You can legally use my code however your project needs."

It may also:

- Confirm you’re not breaking any company rules
    
- Cover patent rights or commercial use

### Why it matters:

- Big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apache need this for legal safety
	
- You usually sign it once, then contribute freely
